# Data junior course


## Iris
As this exercise I have built an automatic learning model with the scikit-learn package in Python to build a simple classification model (to classify Iris flowers) using the random forest algorithm

I have followed the video of the Professor Data Professor https://youtu.be/XmSlFPDjKdc.

## Comparing-classifiers

We will generate a synthetic classification dataset and compare an exhaustive set of 14 machine learning algorithms from the scikit-learn package.
